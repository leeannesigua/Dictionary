# Price Lookup Application

This program is an example of an applicatoin that uses a very common interface, the DictionaryADT. The application program consists of the java class ProductLookup.

The DictionaryADT must be implemented in three ways:
1. Binary Search Tree
2. HashTable with chaining
3. Red/Black Tree
  The first two implementaions were written in my own code. The Red/Black tree implementation uses the Java API class java.util.TreeMap.

The project has seven files:
1. ProductLookup.java: The application program
2. DictionaryADT.java: The dictionary interface (provided)
3. BinarySearchTree.java: The binary search tree implementation of the DictionaryADT
4. HashTable.java: The hash table implementation of the DicitonaryADT. You must using chaining
5. LinearList.java: (Use LinearList class from project #2)
6. LinearListADT.java: the linear list interface from projects #1 and #2
7. RedBlackTree.java: The red/black tree implentation of the DictionaryADT. Uses the Java TreeMap class
